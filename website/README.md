## User Guidance of the Website

This section will detailed explain every page and give you an overview about the stories we want to tell. 

### Home Page

In this page, you will first see the reported number of the homeless spotted in NYC by today in year 2016. 
This is a real time data analytics based on the 311 database provided by NYC Open Data. 

Scroll down, you will see a visualization about the number of homeless people on the street reported from 2010. You can play with the
visualization to explore more, such as the growing trends, the migration and etc. by simply clicking the year or the 
location or both as a filter, then the visualization map on the left , and the year map on the upper right will start
to change and show the real time analytics and visualization results based on your customized filter.  

When you move your mouse across the visualization, you can see the detailed information, such as the total number of homeless
people or the geolocation. For the year map, the larger the circle is, the more homeless people it has for a specific year and location.

Clicking "Behind the Statistic Button" will lead you to our Background page.

### Background Page

In this page, we listed two mainly reasons that more and more people become homeless and live on the street. 
We interviewed several experts and searched tons of news reports. We found because of the high housing rent and 
lack of centralized source of resources for combatting homelessness, some of college students become homeless people 
after the graduation, even homeless people don't want to go to the shelters.

We also found because of some of the shelters may involve mental illness patient, it becomes unsafe to live in the shelters.
For more detailed stories we explored, please click on the Interview Page.

### Interview Page

In this page, we listed three experts who's willing to accept our interviews and told us more stories behind the statistics.
They shared their experiences and opinions, which motivated us to set up a platform to centralized source of resources for combatting homelessness.

### Solution Page

In this page, we provide a plotform that shelters can use tweet us information about themselves. Information can be food information,
space availability information, course or program availability information, weather information and etc.. We store all these information 
on Amazon AWS RDS, and use Tableau to visualize it. We try to provide a platform that volunteers know the current needs about the 
shelters, and homeless people know where to find their needs and resources.

### Contact Page

We clearly know that our strength is too small, and our resources is not wide enough. However, we have warm-hearted people from the society.
So if people know some external information, or people want to report something, he or she can leave us a message, we can reach out.
Hopefully by doing this, our platform can become more powerful and comprehensive, help to reallocation of resources, and surviving more people.

### About Us Page

We are a excellent and professional team. We are risk taker, passionate, doer and solution thinker.
